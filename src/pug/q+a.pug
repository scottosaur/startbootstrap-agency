                    .text-left
                        p We do not have specific hotel reservations. There are numerous excellent options both near the river as well as throughout the city, and we would be happy to make suggestions if needed. Feel free to #[a(href="mailto:kestella1@gmail.com") contact us directly] if you need assistance choosing a location.

                    .text-left
                        p While we’d love to accommodate any guests who’d like to join us, we are quite limited by the size of the boat itself. We ask that you check the Reply card in your invitation to verify the number of spaces we have reserved for your party. If you have any questions or need clarification, please #[a(href="mailto:kestella1@gmail.com") contact us directly]

                        p.lead A wedding on a boat? What should I wear?
                    .text-left
                        p We kindly suggest that you dress for a "cruise to cocktail" atmosphere. We want our guests to feel elegant but comfortable, keeping in mind we will be outdoors in early summer. Be aware that this is a “rain or shine” event; the lower deck of the boat is fully enclosed in the event of uncooperative weather.

                        p.lead When should I arrive to board?
                    .text-left
                        p We strongly encourage our guests to arrive early to ensure a smooth boarding process. Our boat is scheduled to depart promptly at 7:45PM and will be unable to wait for late arrivals. The Riverwalk area is lovely, and seating and beverages are available very close to the dock.

                        p.lead Where can I park?
                    .text-left
                        p There are multiple garage options within a short walking distance, but the closest is LAZ Parking Service Garage located at 111 E. Wacker Dr. This garage is attached to the Chicago Architecture Center and has an exit very close to the boat’s boarding area. We highly recommend the SpotHero app for the best parking rates in the area. Further parking details are available on the #[a(href="https://www.cruisechicago.com/location") Chicago’s First Lady Cruises website] (scroll down to the “Parking” section).

                    .text-left
                        p We will be serving a light meal of small plates inspired by our Chicago favorites followed by cake. Wine, beer, cider, and cocktails will be provided to toast our future together.

                        p.lead Do you have a gift registry?
                    .text-left
                        p The biggest gift you can give us is your presence for this celebration and your continued love and support of our family. We have been blessed to build a household over our years together. If you would like to contribute a gift, we have created a honeymoon fund (available here) to help us continue celebrating our life together.
